[FEATURES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED:]

[FIXED]
MAJOR FEATURE - The overlays denoting which turn it is needs to be changed to state whether its player 1's or 2's go. 
Additionally the win and lose pop ups need to be corrected so it correctly states whether you won or not.

[FIXED]
Change overlays so that a different overlay is displayed for when the opponent is placing ships rather than the generic 'enemy turn' one.

[FIXED]
Prevent the place menu appearing on the receiving client while the main client is trying to place ships.

[FIXED]
MAJOR FEATURE - Enemy ships need to be hidden. This just requires commenting out and adding in some calls for UnhideAllShips and HideAllShips

[FIXED]
MAJOR FEATURE - There needs to be a way to prevent you acting on an enemy turn. I (Daniel) think this could be implemented by creating an overlay 
similar to the your turn ones and using it to block player input. This would need to pop up every time your opppoent goes to shoot telling you 
its the enemy turn and preventing any inputs from being registered. 
Something similar would be needed to tell you your opponent is placing ships. Maybe be done in the switch case in update line 194 however no overlay has
been added.

[FIXED]
The menu button on the victory screen does not correctly link back to the original menu as photon trys to connect again and crashes. 
This either needs LobbyManager to be fixed or if we are going to copy and paste in the room system Jan madewe need to check it works with that.

[FIXED]
Tiles selected and ships placed get sent successfully between both clients. Basic multiplayer is functional and as long as the game isn't played by
anyone it probably looks fine for the MVP showcase.
