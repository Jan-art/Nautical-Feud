[CURRENT ERRORS]

Minor error - Rotations, while functional, do not reflect the true direction a ship is facing. To implement this it would be necessary 
to change the tile selected based on the direction the ship is facing and the ship length and then rotate it so it faces the 
correct direction.



[FIXED ERRORS]

Error - Missile does not fire on reciving client.

Minor error - In relation to rotations being slightly dodgy corvettes rotate as well when they aren't supposed to.

EFFECTIVLY FIXED AS INPUTS ARE BLOCKED ON YOUR TURN
MAJOR ERROR - Issues are caused with the 'Your turn' overlays if a photon event is sent, sometimes freezes.

MAJOR ERROR - Player 1 gets stuck with the Place menu on their screen after player 2 sends them the information for ship locations. 
This needs fixing but it should just be changing a line of code somewhere that calls for the menu to be used.

MAJOR ERROR - Clear all button broke. Probably just deselected something on accident.

Player two doesn't send ships to player one. This just needs adding in the shipPlacement method in Gamemanager of P2PlaceShips

Excluding the Corvette: Ship's hitboxes arn't correct, they get shifted down shipLength - 1 spaces, no implementation for rotation. 
Issues located either in PlaceSystemEvent.PlaceShip or GameManager.UpdateGrid (second version with more arguments).
