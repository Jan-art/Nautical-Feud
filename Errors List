Clear all button broke. Probably just deselected something on accident.

Excluding the Corvette: Ship's hitboxes arn't correct, they get shifted down shipLength - 1 spaces, no implementation for rotation. 
Issues located either in PlaceSystemEvent.PlaceShip or GameManager.UpdateGrid (second version with more arguments). 

Issues are caused with the 'Your turn' overlays if a photon event is sent, sometimes freezes.

Player two doesn't send ships to player one. This just needs adding in the shipPlacement method in Gamemanager of P2PlaceShips
