# Nautical Feud

**DESCRIPTION**

- 3D Game with Top-Down-Perspective based on the traditional board game known as "Battleships" with special tweaks of our own, including an "Advanced" Mode which allows the player to use special PowerUps that adds to the thrill of playing this enthusiastic game-mode. (More Info regarding the PowerUps can be found within the game)

- The game will consist of turn-based Mutiplayer between 2 clients, so you are required to have stable internet connection in order to play as it's fully Multiplayer.

<br />

**MULTIPLAYER**

- Core of the game has been hard-scripted, whereas the Multiplayer side of the game was developed using the Network-component known as `Photon.Engine PUN2`.
- Multiplayer consists of using `RaiseEvents()` to send data between the 2 clients.
- For the backend of the game we are using a component called `PlayFab`.

<br />
<br />

**SETUP**

In order to play the game you have to RUN an `.EXE` file which contains the **Installation-Setup** for our game. 

This can be found in the folder called `NauticalFeud_Setup` located in `GameBuild` > `NauticalFeud_Setup`.

**NOTE**

- Since this game is for a Uni-project only "2" Ship Models are currently active, as it was required for demonstration purposes.
