# Nautical Feud
This is for a Uni project. 

- 2D Game with Top-Down-Perspective based on the traditional board game known as Battleships with special tweaks of our own, including an Advanced Mode which allows the player to use special PowerUps to add thrill to the game. Contains 3D Ship Models.
- The game will consist of turn-based Mutiplayer between 2 clients, so you are required to have stable internet connection in order to play as it's fully Multiplayer.

- Core of the game has been hard-scripted, whereas the Multiplayer side of the game was developed using the Network-component known as Photon.Engine PUN2.
- Multiplayer consists of using RaiseEvents() to send data between the 2 clients.
