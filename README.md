# Nautical Feud
This is for a Uni project. 

- 3D Game with Top-Down-Perspective based on the traditional board game known as "Battleships" with special tweaks of our own, including an "Advanced" Mode which allows the player to use special PowerUps that adds to the thrill of playing this enthusiastic game-mode. (More Info regarding the PowerUps can be found within the game)

- The game will consist of turn-based Mutiplayer between 2 clients, so you are required to have stable internet connection in order to play as it's fully Multiplayer.

- Core of the game has been hard-scripted, whereas the Multiplayer side of the game was developed using the Network-component known as Photon.Engine PUN2.
- Multiplayer consists of using RaiseEvents() to send data between the 2 clients.

- In order to run the final game you have RUN the Installation.Setup which is an `.EXE` file that can be foun in the folder called `GameBuild` > `NauticalFeud_Setup`
